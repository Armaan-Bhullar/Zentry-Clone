## 🚀 Project Purpose

This project was created **strictly for self-development and learning purposes**. It aims to understand and replicate high-quality animations, layouts, and scroll effects found on award-winning websites like Zentry.

✅ **I do not claim any ownership** over Zentry's original design, branding, or content.  
✅ **No commercial use** is intended.  
✅ **No attempt to misrepresent** or plagiarize any part of their work.

## 💡 What I Learned

- Scroll-based animations with GSAP ScrollTrigger

- Component-based structure and props in React
- Clean UI transitions and image scaling effects
